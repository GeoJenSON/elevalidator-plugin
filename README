JOSM-Plugin Elevator Validation
=============================== 

 * This plugin for the Java OpenstreetMap editor was developed to automatically identify and remove
   duplicate elevator highways with different level tags. All duplicate elevator highways except
   one are removed. The remaining elevator object receives a new level tag that includes all the
   levels of the removed elevator objects. Thus the regarding elevators are tagged correctly
   according to the Simple Indoor Tagging Schema.

 * All the main classes of the plugin are modified versions of the corresponding classes of the original JOSM Validator tool.

 * Please note: This plugin is highly experimental and at the moment it only works properly in specific situations.
